# Configuration for my Linux environment

These are the configuration files for my Linux environment which I use on my Surface Pro 3 and desktop computer.

## i3 config

I use i3 as my window manager.

The "i3-wm-config" directory contains the configuration files for i3 itself (look for the "config" file for the main configuration), along with scripts for startup tasks (set_dpi.sh) and locking the screen (lock.sh).

## i3blocks

Better status bar for i3, configuration file in the "i3blocks" directory.

## Vim Config

Vim setup with autocompletion and error checking. I do the vast majority of my coding in it.
