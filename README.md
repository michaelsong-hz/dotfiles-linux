# Configuration files for the i3 window manager

These are the configuration files for the i3 window manager which I use on my Surface Pro 3.

The "i3" directory contains the configuration file for i3 itself (hotkeys, startup tasks etc.), along with scripts, while the "i3status" directory contains the configuration file for the i3status bar.
